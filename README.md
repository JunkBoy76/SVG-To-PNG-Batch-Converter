Follow the steps below to get the project up and running on your local machine.


1.1 Clone or Download the Project:
If you have the project hosted on a version control platform like GitHub, you can clone it. Otherwise, make sure all the files are in a single directory on your machine.


1.2 Install Dependencies:
Navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt. If you've set up a virtual environment (recommended), make sure it's activated.


Install the required Python packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt


1.3 Run the Python Script:
In the same directory, execute the main Python script:
python batch_svg2png.py


This will launch the graphical user interface for the SVG to PNG converter.

2. Using the Tool:
Launch the Interface: Running the script will bring up the graphical user interface.
Select Directories: Use the "Browse" buttons to select the input directory (containing SVG files) and the output directory (where PNG files will be saved).
Start Conversion: Click the "Start Conversion" button. The tool will begin converting the SVG files to PNG format.
Monitor Progress: The progress of the conversion will be displayed. Once complete, a message box will notify you.


3. Additional Notes:
Always back up your SVG files before running the conversion, especially if you're trying the tool for the first time.
If you encounter any issues or need more features, you can modify the batch_svg2png.py script.
Make sure to regularly commit your changes if you're using version control (like Git) to track the project's progress.
